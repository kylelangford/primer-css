/*
This .scss loop will create "margin helpers" and "padding helpers" for use in your web projects.
It will generate several classes such as:
.m-r-10 which gives margin-right 10 pixels.
.m-r-15 gives MARGIN to the RIGHT 15 pixels.
.m-t-15 gives MARGIN to the TOP 15 pixels and so on.
.p-b-5 gives PADDING to the BOTTOM of 5 pixels
.p-l-40 gives PADDING to the LEFT of 40 pixels
The first letter is "m" or "p" for MARGIN or PADDING
Second letter is "t", "b", "l", or "r" for TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT
Third letter is the number of spacing in pixels. Adjust the amounts generated by editing the $spaceamounts variable below.

// To me, the biggest difference between padding and margin is that vertical margins auto-collapse, and padding doesn't.
// Consider two elements one above the other each with padding of 1em. This padding is considered to be part of the element and is always preserved.
// So you will end up with the content of the first element, followed by the padding of the first element, followed by the padding of the second, followed by the content of the second element.
// Thus the content of the two elements will end up being 2em apart.

// Now replace that padding with 1em margin. Margins are considered to be outside of the element, and margins of adjacent items will overlap.
// So in this example, you will end up with the content of the first element followed by 1em of combined margin followed by the content of the second element. So the content of the two elements is only 1em apart.
// This can be really useful when you know that you want to say 1em of spacing around an element, regardless of what element it is next to.
// The other two big differences are that padding is included in the click region and background color/image, but not the margin.

// The vertical margins only collapse for block elements. For inline block elements the margins are added both vertically and horizontally.

// Typography use margin inline vs block
// clickable space use padding
